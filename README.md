#**Building a Compiler: Translating GILLES Language to LLVM Intermediate Representation
In this project, we developed a recursive-descent parser that translates programs written in
the GILLES language into LLVM Intermediate Representation (LLVM IR). This work highlights the
process of building a simple compiler, from parsing high-level constructs to generating efficient
low-level code.
The parser successfully implements key language features, including variable management,
arithmetic operations, control flow constructs (if, while, for), and input/output functions. Through
rigorous testing with diverse GILLES scripts, the correctness and robustness of the parser were validated. Each test demonstrated the accurate translation of GILLES constructs into LLVM IR, ensuring proper execution and optimized performance.
This project showcases the power of LLVM as a backend for compiler construction and provides a strong foundation for future extensions. Potential enhancements include support for more
complex language features, such as functions, arrays, and error handling mechanisms.
By bridging the gap between a high-level custom language and low-level executable code, this
work contributes to the understanding of compiler design and demonstrates the practical application of recursive-descent parsing techniques.
